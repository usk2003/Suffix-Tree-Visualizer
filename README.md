# Suffix Tree Visualizer

This project provides a Python implementation to construct and visualize a suffix tree for a given string. Suffix trees are useful in various applications, such as string matching, data compression, and bioinformatics. The visualizer uses `matplotlib` to render the tree structure.

## 🚀 Features

- **Suffix Tree Construction**: Implements Ukkonen's algorithm to build a suffix tree.
- **Visualization**: Generates a graphical representation of the suffix tree using `matplotlib`.
- **Interactive Input**: Enter a word to visualize its suffix tree.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 🐍
- Required libraries:
  - `matplotlib`

## 📦 Installation
